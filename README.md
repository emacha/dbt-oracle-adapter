# Oracle DBT Adapter

This is an attempt to implement a dbt adapter for Oracle from
scratch. Half as a learning exercise, half so I can have 
a nicer workflow at my job.

I don't think I'll ever implement all features,
but I want to at least reach a point where it's usable.
Without being more trouble than it's worth.

TODO:
- Macros in `not_implemented.sql`
- A decent readme
- stick it in github
    - Use their docker thing for the test db?
    - CI/CD with actions
- Correctly implement the dbt classes e.g. types (https://docs.getdbt.com/reference/dbt-classes)
